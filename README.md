# Get GNU/Linux!

This is the web application for the
[www.getgnulinux.org](https://www.getgnulinux.org) site. Get GNU/Linux! is a
simple, clear website about GNU/Linux. What is GNU/Linux? Why not Windows? Tips
to make the switch. With this website we hope to reach people who never heard
about free software and barely remotely heard the word "Linux".

## Quick start

You can use Docker to setup a local build and test environment. You will first
need to [install Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Start the build environment with:

    ./docker/start.sh

This should open a Bash shell inside the Docker container.
Inside the container, initialize the build environment with:

    ./configure --localedir=/home/node/getgnulinux/docroot/locale/

**NOTE:** These and other common commands are already in your Bash history. Use
Arrow-Up to see them.

**NOTE:** If the above command gives you a "Permission denied" error, it is
because you execute Docker with a user that has a UID other than 1000. The node
user inside the Docker container uses UID 1000. To work around this issue, give
user with UID 1000 read-write access to the project directory.

You should now be able to run `make` commands inside the container.

When translatable content is updated, update the translation files with:

    make update-po

Build the website:

    make

Install the build to the development server:

    make install

The website should now be accessible at <http://localhost:1337/>.

To stop the web server, exit the development container and run:

    ./docker/stop.sh
