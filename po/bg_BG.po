"Quite a few GNU/Linux distributions do not include MP3 playback software due "

"the user directly, so most distributions make it fairly easy to install MP3 "

"Here's the short version of the answer: No. If you simply <em>never run "
"untrusted executables while logged in as the root user (or equivalent)</em>, "
"all the \"virus checkers\" in the world will be at best superfluous; at "
"worst, downright harmful. \"Hostile\" executables (including viruses) are "
"<em>almost unfindable</em> in the GNU/Linux world &ndash; and no real threat "
"to it &ndash; because they lack superuser authority, and because GNU/Linux "
"admins are seldom stupid enough to run untrusted executables as a superuser, "
"<em>and</em> because GNU/Linux users' customary and recommended sources for "
"privileged executables enjoy paranoid-grade scrutiny (such that any "
"unauthorised changes would be detected and remedied)."
